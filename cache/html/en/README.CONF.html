<h1>WWWOFFLE - Configuration File - Version 2.9</h1>


<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The configuration file (wwwoffle.conf) specifies all of the parameters that
control the operation of the proxy server.  The file is split into sections
each containing a series of parameters as described below.  The file
CHANGES.CONF explains the changes in the configuration file between this
version of the program and previous ones.
<p>
The file is split into sections, each of which can be empty or contain one or
more lines of configuration information.  The sections are named and the order
that they appear in the file is not important.
<p>
The general format of each of the sections is the same.  The name of the
section is on a line by itself to mark the start.  The contents of the section
are enclosed between a pair of lines containing only the '{' and '}'
characters or the '[' and ']' characters.  When the '{' and '}' characters are
used the lines between contain configuration information.  When the '[' and
']' characters are used then there must only be a single non-empty line
between them that contains the name of a file (in the same directory)
containing the configuration information for the section.
<p>
Comments are marked by a '#' character at the start of the line and they are
ignored.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored.
<p>
The phrases <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> (or <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a> for short) and <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a> have
specific meanings in the configuration file and are described at the end.  Any
item enclosed in '(' and ')' in the descriptions means that it is a parameter
supplied by the user, anything enclosed in '[' and ']' is optional, the '|'
symbol is used to denote alternate choices.  Some options apply to specific
URLs only, this is indicated by having a <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> enclosed between
'&lt;' &amp; '&gt;' in the option, the first <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> to match is used.  If no
<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> is given then it matches all URLs.

<h2><a name="StartUp"></a>StartUp</h2>

<p>
This contains the parameters that are used when the program starts, changes to
these are ignored if the configuration file is re-read while the program is
running.

<h3><a name="StartUp_bind-ipv4"></a>bind-ipv4 = (hostname) | (ip-address) | none</h3>

<p>
Specify the hostname or IP address to bind the HTTP proxy and WWWOFFLE
control port sockets to using IPv4 (default='0.0.0.0').  If 'none' is
specified then no IPv4 socket is bound.  If this is changed from the
default value then the first entry in the LocalHost section may need
to be changed to match.

<h3><a name="StartUp_bind-ipv6"></a>bind-ipv6 = (hostname) | (ip-address) | none</h3>

<p>
Specify the hostname or IP address to bind the HTTP proxy and WWWOFFLE
control port sockets to using IPv6 (default='::').  If 'none' is
specified then no IPv6 socket is bound.  This requires the IPv6
compilation option.  If this is changed from the default value then
the first entry in the LocalHost section may need to be changed to
match.

allowed).  This option should be set to *:443 to allow https to the
default port number.  There can be more than one option for other
ports or hosts as required.  This option takes precedence over the
allow-cache option.  The host value is matched against the URL as
presented, no hostname to IP or IP to hostname lookups are performed
to find alternative equivalent names.

should be set to *:443 to allow https to the default port number.
There can be more than one option for other ports or hosts as
required.  The host value is matched against the URL as presented, no
hostname to IP or IP to hostname lookups are performed to find
alternative equivalent names.  Requires GnuTLS compilation option.

<h2><a name="LocalHost"></a>LocalHost</h2>

<p>
A list of hostnames that the host running the WWWOFFLE server may be known by.
This is so that the proxy does not need to contact itself if the request has a
different name for the same server.

<h3><a name="LocalHost_(host)"></a>(host)</h3>

<p>
A hostname or IP address that in connection with the port number (in
the StartUp section) specifies the WWWOFFLE proxy HTTP server.  The
hostnames must match exactly, it is not a <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a> match.  The first
named host is used as the server name for several features so must be
a name that will work from any client host on the network.  The
entries can be hostnames, IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses enclosed
within '[...]'.  None of the hosts named here are cached or fetched
via a proxy.

<h2><a name="LocalNet"></a>LocalNet</h2>

<p>
A list of hostnames whose web servers are always accessible even when offline
and are not to be cached by WWWOFFLE because they are on a local network.

<h3><a name="LocalNet_(host)"></a>(host)</h3>

<p>
A hostname or IP address that is always available and is not to be
cached by WWWOFFLE.  The host name matching uses <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a>s.  A host
can be excluded by appending a '!' to the start of the name.  The host
value is matched against the URL as presented, no hostname to IP or IP
to hostname lookups are performed to find alternative equivalent
names.  The entries can be hostnames, IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses
enclosed within '[...]'.  All entries here are assumed to be reachable
even when offline.  None of the hosts named here are cached or fetched
via a proxy.

<h2><a name="AllowedConnectHosts"></a>AllowedConnectHosts</h2>

<p>
A list of client hostnames that are allowed to connect to the server.

<h3><a name="AllowedConnectHosts_(host)"></a>(host)</h3>

<p>
A hostname or IP address that is allowed to connect to the server.
The host name matching uses <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a>s.  A host can be excluded by
appending a '!' to the start of the name.  If the IP address or
hostname (if available) of the machine connecting matches then it is
allowed.  The entries can be hostnames, IPv4 addresses or IPv6
addresses enclosed within '[...]'.  All of the hosts named in
LocalHost are also allowed to connect.

<h2><a name="AllowedConnectUsers"></a>AllowedConnectUsers</h2>

<p>
A list of the users that are allowed to connect to the server and their
passwords.

<h3>(username):(password)</h3>

<p>
The username and password of the users that are allowed to connect to
the server.  If this section is left empty then no user authentication
is done.  The username and password are both stored in plaintext
format.  This requires the use of clients that handle the HTTP/1.1
proxy authentication standard.

<h2><a name="DontCache"></a>DontCache</h2>

<p>
A list of URLs that are not to be cached by WWWOFFLE.

<h3>[!]<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a></h3>

<p>
Do not cache any URLs that match this.  The <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> can be
negated to allow matches to be cached.  The URLs that are not cached
will not have requests recorded if offline or fetched automatically.

<h2><a name="DontGet"></a>DontGet</h2>

<p>
A list of URLs that are not to be got by WWWOFFLE when it is fetching and not
to be served from the WWWOFFLE cache even if they exist.

<h3>[!]<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a></h3>

<p>
Do not get any URLs that match this.  The <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> can be
negated to allow matches to be got.

<h3><a name="DontGet_replacement"></a>[&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;] replacement = (URL)</h3>

<p>
The URL to use to replace any URLs that match the <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a>s
instead of using the standard error message (default=none).  The URLs
in /local/dontget/ are suggested replacements (e.g. replacement.gif or
replacement.png which are 1x1 pixel transparent images or
replacement.js which is an empty javascript file).

<h3><a name="DontGet_get-recursive"></a>&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt; get-recursive = yes | no</h3>

<p>
Choose whether to get URLs that match this when doing a recursive
fetch (default=yes).

<h3><a name="DontGet_location-error"></a>&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt; location-error = yes | no</h3>

<p>
When a URL reply contains a 'Location' header that redirects to a URL
that is not got (specified in this section) then the reply is modified
to be an error message instead (default=no).  This will stop ISP
proxies from redirecting users to adverts if the advert URLs are
in this section.

<h2><a name="DontCompress"></a>DontCompress</h2>

<p>
A list of MIME types and file extensions that are not to be compressed by
WWWOFFLE (because they are already compressed or not worth compressing).

<p>
A header field name (e.g. From, Cookie, Set-Cookie, User-Agent) and
the string to replace the header value with (default=no).  The header
is case sensitive, and does not have a ':' at the end.  The value of
"no" means that the header is unmodified, "yes" or no string can be
used to remove the header or a string can be used to replace the
header.  This only replaces headers it finds, it does not add any new
ones.  An option for Referer here will take precedence over the
referer-self and referer-self-dir options.

<h3><a name="CensorHeader_referer-self"></a>[&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;] referer-self = yes | no</h3>

<p>

<p>
Sets the Referer header to the directory name of the URL being
requested (default=no).  This will add the Referer header if none is
contained in the original request.  This option takes precedence over
referer-self.

<h3><a name="CensorHeader_referer-from"></a>[&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;] referer-from = yes | no</h3>

<p>
Removes the Referer header based on a match of the referring URL
(default=no).

<h3><a name="CensorHeader_force-user-agent"></a>[&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;] force-user-agent = yes | no</h3>

<p>
Forces a User-Agent header to be inserted into all requests that are
made by WWWOFFLE (default=no).  This User-Agent is added only if there
is not an existing User-Agent header and is set to the value
WWWOFFLE/&lt;version-number&gt;.  This header is inserted before censoring
and may be changed by the normal header censoring method.

The default MIME type (default=text/plain).

<h3><a name="MIMETypes_.(file-ext)"></a>.(file-ext) = (mime-type)/(subtype)</h3>

<p>
The MIME type to associate with a file extension.  The '.' must be
included in the file extension.  If more than one extension matches
then the longest one is used.

<h2><a name="Proxy"></a>Proxy</h2>

<p>
This contains the names of the HTTP (or other) proxies to use external to the
WWWOFFLE server machine.

(SSL) connections.  Note that for the &lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt; that only the host is
checked and that the other parts must be '*' <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a>s.

<h2><a name="Alias"></a>Alias</h2>

<p>
A list of aliases that are used to replace the server name and path with
another server name and path.

<h3><a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> = <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a></h3>

<p>
Any requests that match the first <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> are replaced by
the second <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a>.  The first <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> is a
wildcard match for the protocol and host/port, the path must match the
start of the requested URL exactly and includes all subdirectories.

<h2><a name="Purge"></a>Purge</h2>

<p>
The method to determine which pages to purge, the default age the host
specific maximum age of the pages in days, and the maximum cache size.

<h3><a name="Purge_use-mtime"></a>use-mtime = yes | no</h3>

<p>
The method to use to decide which files to purge, last access time
(atime) or last modification time (mtime) (default=no).

<h3><a name="Purge_max-size"></a>max-size = (size)</h3>

<p>
The maximum size for the cache in MB after purging (default=-1).  A
maximum cache size of -1 (or 0 for backwards compatibility) means
there is no limit to the size.  If this and the min-free options are
both used the smaller cache size is chosen.  This option take into
account the URLs that are never purged when measuring the cache size
but will not purge them.

<h3><a name="Purge_min-free"></a>min-free = (size)</h3>

<p>
The minimum amount of free disk space in MB after purging
(default=-1).  A minimum disk free of -1 (or 0) means there is no
limit to the free space.  If this and the max-size options are both
used the smaller cache size is chosen.  This option take into account
the URLs that are never purged when measuring the cache size but will
not purge them.

<h3><a name="Purge_use-url"></a>use-url = yes | no</h3>

<p>
If true then use the URL to decide on the purge age, otherwise use the
protocol and host only (default=no).

<h3><a name="Purge_del-dontget"></a>del-dontget = yes | no</h3>

<p>
If true then delete the URLs that match the entries in the DontGet
section (default=no).

<h3><a name="Purge_del-dontcache"></a>del-dontcache = yes | no</h3>

<p>
If true then delete the URLs that match the entries in the DontCache
section (default=no).

<h3><a name="Purge_age"></a>[&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;] age = (age)</h3>

<p>
The maximum age in the cache for URLs that match this (default=14).
An age of zero means always to delete, negative means not to delete.
The <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> matches only the protocol and host unless
use-url is set to true. Longer times can be specified with a 'w', 'm'
or 'y' suffix for weeks, months or years (e.g. 2w=14).

<h3><a name="Purge_compress-age"></a>[&lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;] compress-age = (age)</h3>

<p>
The maximum age in the cache for URLs that match this to be stored
uncompressed (default=-1).  Requires zlib compilation option.  An age
of zero means always to compress, negative means never to compress.
The <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> matches only the protocol and host unless
use-url is set to true. Longer times can be specified with a 'w', 'm'
or 'y' suffix for weeks, months or years (e.g. 2w=14).

<h2><a name="WILDCARD"></a>WILDCARD</h2>

<p>
A <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a> match is one that uses the '*' character to represent any group of
characters.
<p>
This is basically the same as the command line file matching expressions in
DOS or the UNIX shell, except that the '*' can match the '/' character.
<p>
For example

<dl>
<dt>*.gif
<dd>matches  foo.gif and bar.gif
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>*.foo.com
<dd>matches  www.foo.com and ftp.foo.com
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>/foo/*
<dd>matches  /foo/bar.html and /foo/bar/foobar.html
</dl>

<h2><a name="URL-SPECIFICATION"></a>URL-SPECIFICATION</h2>

<p>
When specifying a host and protocol and pathname in many of the sections a
<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> can be used, this is a way of recognising a URL.
<p>
For the purposes of this explanation a URL is considered to be made up of five
parts.

<dl>
<dt>proto
<dd>The protocol that is used (e.g. 'http', 'ftp')
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>host
<dd>The server hostname (e.g. 'www.gedanken.demon.co.uk').
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>port
<dd>The port number on the host (e.g. default of 80 for HTTP).
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>path
<dd>The pathname on the host (e.g. '/bar.html') or a directory name
(e.g. '/foo/').
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>args
<dd>Optional arguments with the URL used for CGI scripts etc.
(e.g. 'search=foo').
</dl>
<p>
For example the WWWOFFLE homepage: http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/
The protocol is 'http', the host is 'www.gedanken.demon.co.uk', the port is
the default (in this case 80), and the pathname is '/wwwoffle/'.
<p>
In general this is written as (proto)://(host)[:(port)]/[(path)][?(args)]
<p>
Where [] indicates an optional feature, and () indicate a user supplied name
or number.
<p>
Some example <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> options are the following:

<dl>
<dt>*://*/*
<dd>Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Any path, Any args
(This is the default for options that can have a &lt;<a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPEC</a>&gt;
prefix when none is specified).
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>*://*/(path)
<dd>Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Named path, Any args
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>*://*/*?
<dd>Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Any path, No args
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>*://*/(path)?*
<dd>Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Named path, Any args
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>*://(host)
<dd>Any protocol, Named host, Any port, Any path, Any args
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>(proto)://*/*
<dd>Named proto, Any host, Any port, Any path, Any args
</dl>
<p>
(proto)://(host)/*  Named proto, Named host, Any port, Any path, Any args
<p>
(proto)://(host):/* Named proto, Named host, Default port, Any path, Any args
<p>
*://(host):(port)/* Any protocol, Named host, Named port, Any path, Any args
<p>
The matching of the host, the path and the args use the <a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a> matching that
is described above.  The matching of the path has the special condition that a
<a href="#WILDCARD">WILDCARD</a> of '/*/foo' will match '/foo' and '/any/path/foo', in other words it
matches any path prefix.
<p>
In some sections that accept <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a>s they can be negated by
inserting the '!' character before it.  This will mean that the comparison
of a URL with the <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a> will return the logically opposite value
to what would be returned without the '!'.  If all of the <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a>s
in a section are negated and '*://*/*' is added to the end then the sense of
the whole section is negated.
<p>
In all sections that accept <a href="#URL-SPECIFICATION">URL-SPECIFICATION</a>s the comparison can be made case
insensitive for the path and arguments part by inserting the '~' character
before it.  (The host and the protocol comparisons are always case
insensitive).
