<h2>Help</h2>

$reason?=ReadError{

The configuration file could not be opened or could be opened but the contents
could not be understood.  Check that the file <tt>wwwoffle.conf</tt> that was
used to start the <tt>wwwoffled</tt> program exists.  It must also be readable
by the user that the program is running as.

}{}
$reason?=BadSection{

The forms on the Configuration File Edit page are the only ones that can be used
to update the configuration file.  All of the forms on that page will allow
modification of one of the sections of the configuration file.  The request that
your browser sent does not match one of these sections.  Check that you are
using the correct forms to update the information.

}{}
$reason?=BadBody{

The browser has sent an invalid response to the form on the Configuration File
Edit page.  Either the browser sent an empty reply instead of the form data,
there was a network error sending the form data or the data that was sent was
invalid.  You should try to fill in the information in the form again and send
it again.

}{}
$reason?=WriteError{

The configuration file could not be opened for writing.  Check that the file
<tt>wwwoffle.conf</tt> that was used to start the <tt>wwwoffled</tt> program
exists.  It must also be writable by the user that the program is running as.
