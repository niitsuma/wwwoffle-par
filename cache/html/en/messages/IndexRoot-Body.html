<h2>Main Index</h2>

This is the main index page for all of the files in the wwwoffle cache.

The index of the files in the cache has changed in version 2.0 of wwwoffle
compared to earlier versions.
<br>
This is for a number of reasons:

<ul>
  <li>So that the new protocol types can be introduced.
  <li>To present a consistent interface for all of the index pages (the new
      button bars).
  <li>To improve the formatting and layout.
</ul>
It is hoped that this new format is easier to use and makes more sense than the
previous version.

<h3>First Level Index</h3>

This page is the first level index, it is available on the first of the button
bars.

<h3>Second Level Indexes</h3>

Below the main index there are several second level indexes as shown on the
second of the button bars.
<br>
These indexes are:
<dl>
  <dt>Outgoing
  <dd>The index of the requests that have been made while offline and are
      waiting to be fetched.
  <dt>Monitored
  <dd>The index of the pages that are automatically monitored at fixed
      intervals.
  <dt>Last Time
  <dd>All of the pages from all protocols that were updated the last time that
      wwwoffle was online.  This also provides access to a history of the files
      that were accessed the previous five times.
  <dt>Last Outgoing
  <dd>All of the pages from all protocols that were in the outgoing directory
      the last time that wwwoffle fetched pages.  This also provides access to a
      history of the files that were requested offline the previous five times.
  <dt>Protocols (http,ftp etc.)
  <dd>Each of the protocols that wwwoffle supports has an index showing the
      hosts that have pages stored.
</dl>

<h3>Third Level Indexes</h3>

Below the protocol indexes there are third level indexes (not shown on the button bars).
<br>
These indexes are the list of pages from a particular host using a particular protocol.

<h2>Sorting</h2>

All of the second and third level indexes can be sorted in several ways using
the third button bar.
<br>
These methods are:
<dl>
  <dt>Unsorted
  <dd>No sorting applied, this uses the default directory order.
  <dt>Modification Time
  <dd>The time that the page was last modified (most recent first), this could
      be when it was fetched or refreshed.
  <dt>Access Time
  <dd>The time that the page was last accessed (most recent first), this is the
      time that the page was last viewed (if later than modification time).
  <dt>Date Changed
  <dd>The same as for "Modification Time", but with separators for every day and
      a blank line for gaps of an hour or more.
  <dt>Alphabetical
  <dd>The pages are sorted into alphabetical order.
  <dt>Domain Name
  <dd>The pages are sorted into order according to the domain name of the host.
  <dt>File Type
  <dd>The pages are sorted alphabetically according to the file extension.
  <dt>Random
  <dd>The Pages are displayed in a random (but reproducible) order, so successively
      fetched pages don't appear next to each other.
</dl>

<h2>Display Options</h2>

The pages that are listed have a number of optional buttons to allow the page to
be deleted or refreshed etc.  These buttons can be turned on and off with the
fourth button bar.
<br>
These options are:
<dl>
  <dt>Delete Options
  <dd>A button to allow the page to be deleted from the cache.  There is also a
      method of selecting more than one page with a button to delete the
      selected pages.  Some of the index pages also allow all of the cached
      files to be deleted at once.
  <dt>Refresh Options
  <dd>Two buttons, one to force a refresh the page and one to select refresh
      option for recursive fetching.
  <dt>Monitor Options
  <dd>A button to add the page to the list of URLs that are monitored on a
      regular basis.
  <dt>All Pages / Selected Pages
  <dd>This does not add any buttons to the index, but will display the entire
      index or filter it by using the <tt>dont-index</tt> items in the
      <tt>IndexOptions</tt> section of the configuration file.
  <dt>Config Options
  <dd>A button to allow the configuration file entries for this URL to be
      modified.
</dl>
