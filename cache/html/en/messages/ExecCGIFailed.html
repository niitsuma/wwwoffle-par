The URL that you specified is for a local CGI program on the WWWOFFLE server.  For one
reason or another this program could not be succesfully executed.  The possible
reasons for the error include:

<ul>
  <li>The file that contains the CGI program does not have the necessary execution permissions.
  <li>The CGI program encountered an error and terminated abnormally.
  <li>The server is running with root privileges and is configured not to run CGI programs in that case.
  <li>The server ran out of the necessary system resources while trying to execute the CGI program.
</ul>

Check the system logfiles for more information.
