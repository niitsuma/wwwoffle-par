<h2 class="wwwoffle-inline-help">Help</h2>

<div class="wwwoffle-inline-help">
The WWWOFFLE server was unable to complete the request for this URL due to a
problem with downloading this page.  This can be because the remote server could
not send any reply within the socket timeout period or a reply was interrupted
by a time longer than the socket timeout period with no data.  The other
possible reason for this error message is that the browser closed the connection
before the whole of the page had been downloaded.  The exact reason in this case
is shown in the error message above.
<p>
When a backup version of the page exists in the cache then reloading this page
will display that version.  When there is no backup cached version then
reloading this page will request it again.
