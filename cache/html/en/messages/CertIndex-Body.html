<h2>WWWOFFLE Certificate Authority</h2>

The WWWOFFLE Certificate Authority certificate is used by WWWOFFLE to
authenticate all of the other certificates that it creates.  This is the master
certificate.  A unique certificate is created if there is not already one
present when it is started.  The certificates for two different WWWOFFLE servers
should be different even though they perform the same task, they are not
interchangeable.

}{}

$header?=server{
<h2>WWWOFFLE Server</h2>

The WWWOFFLE server certificate is used by WWWOFFLE when access is requested to
one of the internal WWWOFFLE pages using HTTPS.  A different certificate needs
to be created for each of the possible names that the server can be accessed as.

}{}

$header?=fake{
<h2>Fake Server</h2>

The fake server certificates are created by WWWOFFLE when a request is made for
an HTTPS web-page and WWWOFFLE is going to cache it.  The page that is sent to
the browser from WWWOFFLE for this server will use this certificate.

}{}

$header?=real{
<h2>Real Server</h2>

The real server certificates are what the real web server sends back to WWWOFFLE
when a request is made for an HTTPS page from the server.  These are the
certicates that a browser would see if contacting the page directly.

}{}

$header?=trusted{
<h2>Trusted Certificate Authorities</h2>

The trusted certificates are an optional list of certificates that WWWOFFLE can
trust so that the real certificates from servers can be authenticated.
