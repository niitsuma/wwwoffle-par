                How WWWOFFLE finds files in the html directory
                ==============================================

All directory paths listed here are local to the WWWOFFLE cache directory which
is usually /var/spool/wwwoffle, but should in any case be one directory back
from the directory that contains this file.

The language that is selected is the one that is requested by the browser in the
'Accept-Language' header that it sent with the request.  This is shown in the
following examples as $LANG, this will be a two letter code.


When a browser requests the URL '/xyz' (note there cannot be any '/' in 'xyz')
then WWWOFFLE will use the first of the following files that it finds:

1)      html/$LANG/xyz
2)      html/default/xyz
3)      html/en/xyz
4)      An internally generated error message


When a browser requests the URL '/search/$search/xyz' then WWWOFFLE will use the
first of the following files that it finds:

1)      html/$LANG/search/$search/xyz
2)      html/default/search/$search/xyz
3)      html/en/search/$search/xyz
4)      An internally generated error message


When a browser requests the URL '/local/x/y/z' then WWWOFFLE will use the first
of the following files that it finds:

1)      local/x/y/z
2)      html/$LANG/local/x/y/z
3)      html/default/local/x/y/z
4)      html/en/local/x/y/z
5)      An internally generated error message

Note: The '/local/' URL is a special case compared to the others in that the
      directory called 'local' is searched before any of the sub-directories in
      the 'html' directory.  There are no files installed by WWWOFFLE in the
      'local' directory and WWWOFFLE will not modify the contents of this
      directory when a new version is installed.


The purpose of the three-way search ($LANG, 'default' and 'en') is so that the
browser setting has the highest priority, the person who installs WWWOFFLE can
set a default language and finally the English pages are used since they are a
complete set of pages.

When WWWOFFLE is installed the 'default' directory is a symbolic link to the
directory specified when running configure, this can be changed to point to any
other directory if required.


Note: The search scripts and configuration files have been moved out of the
      'html' directory so that the contents of the 'html' directory should not
      need to be modified by the user after installation.
