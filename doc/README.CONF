              WWWOFFLE - Configuration File - Version 2.9
              ===========================================

Introduction
------------

The configuration file (wwwoffle.conf) specifies all of the parameters that
control the operation of the proxy server.  The file is split into sections
each containing a series of parameters as described below.  The file
CHANGES.CONF explains the changes in the configuration file between this
version of the program and previous ones.

The file is split into sections, each of which can be empty or contain one or
more lines of configuration information.  The sections are named and the order
that they appear in the file is not important.

The general format of each of the sections is the same.  The name of the
section is on a line by itself to mark the start.  The contents of the section
are enclosed between a pair of lines containing only the '{' and '}'
characters or the '[' and ']' characters.  When the '{' and '}' characters are
used the lines between contain configuration information.  When the '[' and
']' characters are used then there must only be a single non-empty line
between them that contains the name of a file (in the same directory)
containing the configuration information for the section.

Comments are marked by a '#' character at the start of the line and they are
ignored.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored.

The phrases URL-SPECIFICATION (or URL-SPEC for short) and WILDCARD have
specific meanings in the configuration file and are described at the end.  Any
item enclosed in '(' and ')' in the descriptions means that it is a parameter
supplied by the user, anything enclosed in '[' and ']' is optional, the '|'
symbol is used to denote alternate choices.  Some options apply to specific
URLs only, this is indicated by having a URL-SPECIFICATION enclosed between
'<' & '>' in the option, the first URL-SPECIFICATION to match is used.  If no
URL-SPECIFICATION is given then it matches all URLs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

StartUp
-------

This contains the parameters that are used when the program starts, changes to
these are ignored if the configuration file is re-read while the program is
running.

bind-ipv4 = (hostname) | (ip-address) | none
        Specify the hostname or IP address to bind the HTTP proxy and WWWOFFLE
        control port sockets to using IPv4 (default='0.0.0.0').  If 'none' is
        specified then no IPv4 socket is bound.  If this is changed from the
        default value then the first entry in the LocalHost section may need
        to be changed to match.

bind-ipv6 = (hostname) | (ip-address) | none
        Specify the hostname or IP address to bind the HTTP proxy and WWWOFFLE
        control port sockets to using IPv6 (default='::').  If 'none' is
        specified then no IPv6 socket is bound.  This requires the IPv6
        compilation option.  If this is changed from the default value then
        the first entry in the LocalHost section may need to be changed to
        match.

http-port = (port)
        An integer specifying the port number for connections to access the
        internal WWWOFFLE pages and for HTTP/HTTPS/FTP proxying
        (default=8080).  This is the port number that must be specified in the
        client to connect to the WWWOFFLE proxy for HTTP/HTTPS/FTP proxying.

https-port = (port)
        An integer specifying the port number for encrypted connections to
        access the internal WWWOFFLE pages and for HTTP/FTP proxying
        (default=8443).  Requires gnutls compilation option.

wwwoffle-port = (port)
        An integer specifying the port number for the WWWOFFLE control
        connections to use (default=8081).

spool-dir = (dir)
        The full pathname of the top level cache directory (spool directory)
        (default=/var/spool/wwwoffle or whatever was used when the program was
        compiled).

run-uid = (user) | (uid)
        The username or numeric uid to change to when the WWWOFFLE server is
        started (default=none).  This option only works if the server is
        started by the root user on UNIX-like systems.

run-gid = (group) | (gid)
        The group name or numeric gid to change to when the WWWOFFLE server is
        started (default=none).  This option only works if the server is
        started by the root user on UNIX-like systems.

use-syslog = yes | no
        Whether to use the syslog facility for messages or not (default=yes).

password = (word)
        The password used for authentication of the control pages, for
        deleting cached pages etc (default=none).  For the password to be
        secure the configuration file must be set so that only authorised
        users can read it.

max-servers = (integer)
        The maximum number of server processes that are started for online and
        automatic fetching (default=8).

max-fetch-servers = (integer)
        The maximum number of server processes that are started to fetch pages
        that were marked in offline mode (default=4).  This value must be less
        than max-servers or you will not be able to use WWWOFFLE interactively
        online while fetching.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options
-------

Options that control how the program works.

log-level = debug | info | important | warning | fatal
        The minimum log level for messages in syslog or stderr
        (default=important).

socket-timeout = (time)
        The time in seconds that WWWOFFLE will wait for data on a socket
        connection before giving up (default=120).

dns-timeout = (time)
        The time in seconds that WWWOFFLE will wait for a DNS (Domain Name

        The time in seconds that WWWOFFLE will wait for the socket connection
        to be made before giving up (default=30).

connect-retry = yes | no
        If a connection cannot be made to a remote server then WWWOFFLE should
        try again after a short delay (default=no).

dir-perm = (octal int)

        starting with a '0'.

run-online = (filename)
        The full pathname of a program to run when WWWOFFLE is switched to
        online mode (default=none).  The program is started in the background
        with a single parameter set to the current mode name "online".

run-offline = (filename)
        The full pathname of a program to run when WWWOFFLE is switched to

        "stop".

lock-files = yes | no
        Enable the use of lock files to stop more than one WWWOFFLE process from
        downloading the same URL at the same time (default=no).  Disabling the
        lock-files may result in incomplete pages being displayed or many copies
        being downloaded if multiple requests are made for the same URL at the

[<URL-SPEC>] pragma-no-cache = yes | no
        Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
        has 'Pragma: no-cache' (default=yes).  This option takes precedence
        over the request-changed and request-changed-once options.

[<URL-SPEC>] cache-control-no-cache = yes | no
        Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client

[<URL-SPEC>] cache-control-max-age-0 = yes | no
        Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
        has 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' (default=yes).  This option takes
        precedence over the request-changed and request-changed-once options.

[<URL-SPEC>] cookies-force-refresh = yes | no
        Whether to force the refresh of a page if the request from the client
        contains a cookie (default=no).  This option takes precedence over
        the request-changed and request-changed-once options.

[<URL-SPEC>] request-changed = (time)
        While online pages will only be fetched if the cached version is older
        than this specified time in seconds (default=600).  Setting this value
        negative will indicate that cached pages are always used while online.
        Longer times can be specified with a 'm', 'h', 'd' or 'w' suffix for
        minutes, hours, days or weeks (e.g. 10m=600).

[<URL-SPEC>] request-changed-once = yes | no
        While online pages will only be fetched if the cached version has not

        option takes precedence over the request-changed option.

[<URL-SPEC>] request-expired = yes | no
        While online pages that have expired will always be requested again
        (default=no).  This option takes precedence over the request-changed
        and request-changed-once options.

[<URL-SPEC>] request-no-cache = yes | no
        While online pages that ask not to be cached will always be requested
        again (default=no).  This option takes precedence over the
        request-changed and request-changed-once options.

[<URL-SPEC>] request-redirection = yes | no
        While online pages that redirect the client to another URL temporarily
        will be requested again. (default=no).  This option takes precedence
        over the request-changed and request-changed-once options.

[<URL-SPEC>] request-conditional = yes | no
        While online pages that are requested from the server will be
        conditional requests so that the server only sends data if the page
        has changed (default=yes).

[<URL-SPEC>] validate-with-etag = yes | no
        When making a conditional request to a server enable the use of the
        HTTP/1.1 cache validator 'Etag' as well as modification time
        'If-Modified-Since' (default=yes).  The request-conditional option
        must also be selected for this option to take effect.

[<URL-SPEC>] try-without-password = yes | no
        If a request is made for a URL that contains a username and password
        then a request is made for the same URL without a username and
        password specified (default=yes).  This allows for requests for the
        URL without a password to re-direct the client to the passworded
        version.

[<URL-SPEC>] intr-download-keep = yes | no
        If the client closes the connection while online the currently
        downloaded incomplete page should be kept (default=no).

[<URL-SPEC>] intr-download-size = (integer)

        continue to download if it is smaller than this size in kB
        (default=1).

[<URL-SPEC>] intr-download-percent = (integer)
        If the client closes the connection while online the page should
        continue to download if it is more than this percentage complete
        (default=80).

[<URL-SPEC>] timeout-download-keep = yes | no
        If the server connection times out while reading then the currently
        downloaded incomplete page should be kept (default=no).

[<URL-SPEC>] keep-cache-if-not-found = yes | no
        If the remote server replies with an error message or a redirection
        while there is a cached version with status 200 the previously cached 
        version should be kept (default=no).

[<URL-SPEC>] request-compressed-data = yes | no
        If the requests that are made to the server are to request compressed
        data (default=yes).  Requires zlib compilation option.

        encoding (default=yes).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OfflineOptions
--------------

[<URL-SPEC>] pragma-no-cache = yes | no
        Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
        has 'Pragma: no-cache' (default=yes).  This option should be set to
        'no' if when browsing offline all pages are re-requested by a 'broken'
        browser.

        Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
        has 'Cache-Control: no-cache' (default=yes).  This option should be
        set to 'no' if when browsing offline all pages are re-requested by a
        'broken' browser.

[<URL-SPEC>] cache-control-max-age-0 = yes | no
        Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
        has 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' (default=yes).  This option should be
        set to 'no' if when browsing offline all pages are re-requested by a
        'broken' browser.

[<URL-SPEC>] confirm-requests = yes | no
        Whether to return a page requiring user confirmation instead of
        automatically recording requests made while offline (default=no).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SSLOptions
----------

Options that control how WWWOFFLE behaves when a connection is made to it for an
https or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server.  Normally only tunnelling (with no
decryption or caching of the data) is possible.  When WWWOFFLE is compiled with
the gnutls library it is possible configure WWWOFFLE to decrypt, cache and
re-encrypt the connections.

quick-key-gen = yes | no
        Normally generation of secret keys for the SSL/https functions uses the
        default GnuTLS option for random number source.  This can be slow on
        some machines so this option selects a quicker but less secure random
        number source (default = no).  Requires GnuTLS compilation option.

expiration-time = (age)
        The length of time after creation that each certificate will expire
        (default = 1y).  Requires GnuTLS compilation option.

enable-caching = yes | no
        If caching (involving decryption and re-encryption) of SSL/https
        server connections is allowed (default = no).  Requires GnuTLS
        compilation option.

allow-tunnel = (host[:port])
        A hostname and port number (a WILDCARD match) for an https/SSL server
        that can be connected to using WWWOFFLE as a tunnelling proxy (no
        caching or decryption of the data) (default is no hosts or ports
        allowed).  This option should be set to *:443 to allow https to the
        default port number.  There can be more than one option for other
        ports or hosts as required.  This option takes precedence over the
        allow-cache option.  The host value is matched against the URL as
        presented, no hostname to IP or IP to hostname lookups are performed
        to find alternative equivalent names.

disallow-tunnel = (host[:port])
        A hostname and port number (a WILDCARD match) for an https/SSL server
        that can not be connected to using WWWOFFLE as a tunnelling proxy.
        There can be more than one option for other ports or hosts as
        required.  This option takes precedence over the allow-tunnel option.
        The host value is matched against the URL as presented, no hostname to
        IP or IP to hostname lookups are performed to find alternative
        equivalent names.

allow-cache = (host[:port])
        A hostname and port number (a WILDCARD match) for an https/SSL server
        that can be connected to using WWWOFFLE as a caching proxy (decryption
        of the data) (default is no hosts or ports allowed).  This option
        should be set to *:443 to allow https to the default port number.
        There can be more than one option for other ports or hosts as
        required.  The host value is matched against the URL as presented, no
        hostname to IP or IP to hostname lookups are performed to find
        alternative equivalent names.  Requires GnuTLS compilation option.

disallow-cache = (host[:port])
        A hostname and port number (a WILDCARD match) for an https/SSL server
        that can not be connected to using WWWOFFLE as a caching proxy.  This
        option takes precedence over the allow-cache option.  The host value
        is matched against the URL as presented, no hostname to IP or IP to
        hostname lookups are performed to find alternative equivalent names.
        Requires GnuTLS compilation option.

        replace-webbug-images option in the ModifyHTML section can be used to
        stop browsers requesting them.

[<URL-SPEC>] icon-images = yes | no
        If icons (also called favourite icons or shortcut icons) as used by
        browsers for bookmarks are to be fetched (default=no).

        (default=/local/dontget/replacement.gif).

[<URL-SPEC>] demoronise-ms-chars = yes | no
        Replaces strange characters that some Microsoft applications put into
        HTML with character equivalents that most browsers can display
        (default=no).  The idea for this comes from the public domain
        Demoroniser perl script.

[<URL-SPEC>] fix-mixed-cyrillic = yes | no
        Replaces punctuation characters in cp-1251 encoding that are combined
        with text in koi-8 encoding that appears in some cyrillic web pages.

[<URL-SPEC>] disable-animated-gif = yes | no
        Disables the animation in animated GIF files (default=no).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LocalHost
---------

A list of hostnames that the host running the WWWOFFLE server may be known by.
This is so that the proxy does not need to contact itself if the request has a
different name for the same server.

(host)
        A hostname or IP address that in connection with the port number (in
        the StartUp section) specifies the WWWOFFLE proxy HTTP server.  The
        hostnames must match exactly, it is not a WILDCARD match.  The first
        named host is used as the server name for several features so must be
        a name that will work from any client host on the network.  The
        entries can be hostnames, IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses enclosed
        within '[...]'.  None of the hosts named here are cached or fetched
        via a proxy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LocalNet
--------

A list of hostnames whose web servers are always accessible even when offline
and are not to be cached by WWWOFFLE because they are on a local network.

(host)
        A hostname or IP address that is always available and is not to be
        cached by WWWOFFLE.  The host name matching uses WILDCARDs.  A host
        can be excluded by appending a '!' to the start of the name.  The host
        value is matched against the URL as presented, no hostname to IP or IP
        to hostname lookups are performed to find alternative equivalent
        names.  The entries can be hostnames, IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses
        enclosed within '[...]'.  All entries here are assumed to be reachable
        even when offline.  None of the hosts named here are cached or fetched
        via a proxy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AllowedConnectHosts
-------------------

A list of client hostnames that are allowed to connect to the server.

(host)
        A hostname or IP address that is allowed to connect to the server.
        The host name matching uses WILDCARDs.  A host can be excluded by
        appending a '!' to the start of the name.  If the IP address or
        hostname (if available) of the machine connecting matches then it is
        allowed.  The entries can be hostnames, IPv4 addresses or IPv6
        addresses enclosed within '[...]'.  All of the hosts named in
        LocalHost are also allowed to connect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AllowedConnectUsers
-------------------

A list of the users that are allowed to connect to the server and their
passwords.

(username):(password)
        The username and password of the users that are allowed to connect to
        the server.  If this section is left empty then no user authentication
        is done.  The username and password are both stored in plaintext
        format.  This requires the use of clients that handle the HTTP/1.1
        proxy authentication standard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DontCache
---------

A list of URLs that are not to be cached by WWWOFFLE.

[!]URL-SPECIFICATION
        Do not cache any URLs that match this.  The URL-SPECIFICATION can be
        negated to allow matches to be cached.  The URLs that are not cached
        will not have requests recorded if offline or fetched automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DontGet
-------

A list of URLs that are not to be got by WWWOFFLE when it is fetching and not
to be served from the WWWOFFLE cache even if they exist.

[!]URL-SPECIFICATION
        Do not get any URLs that match this.  The URL-SPECIFICATION can be
        negated to allow matches to be got.

[<URL-SPEC>] replacement = (URL)
        The URL to use to replace any URLs that match the URL-SPECIFICATIONs
        instead of using the standard error message (default=none).  The URLs
        in /local/dontget/ are suggested replacements (e.g. replacement.gif or
        replacement.png which are 1x1 pixel transparent images or
        replacement.js which is an empty javascript file).

<URL-SPEC> get-recursive = yes | no
        Choose whether to get URLs that match this when doing a recursive
        fetch (default=yes).

<URL-SPEC> location-error = yes | no
        When a URL reply contains a 'Location' header that redirects to a URL
        that is not got (specified in this section) then the reply is modified
        to be an error message instead (default=no).  This will stop ISP
        proxies from redirecting users to adverts if the advert URLs are
        in this section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DontCompress
------------

A list of MIME types and file extensions that are not to be compressed by
WWWOFFLE (because they are already compressed or not worth compressing).
Requires zlib compilation option.

mime-type = (mime-type)/(subtype)
        The MIME type of a URL that is not to be compressed in the cache (when
        purging) or when providing pages to clients.

file-ext = .(file-ext)
        The file extension of a URL that is not to be requested compressed
        from a server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CensorHeader
------------

A list of HTTP header lines that are to be removed from the requests sent to
web servers and the replies that come back from them.

[<URL-SPEC>] (header) = yes | no | (string)
        A header field name (e.g. From, Cookie, Set-Cookie, User-Agent) and
        the string to replace the header value with (default=no).  The header
        is case sensitive, and does not have a ':' at the end.  The value of
        "no" means that the header is unmodified, "yes" or no string can be
        used to remove the header or a string can be used to replace the
        header.  This only replaces headers it finds, it does not add any new
        ones.  An option for Referer here will take precedence over the
        referer-self and referer-self-dir options.

[<URL-SPEC>] referer-self = yes | no
        Sets the Referer header to the same as the URL being requested
        (default=no).  This will add the Referer header if none is contained
        in the original request.

[<URL-SPEC>] referer-self-dir = yes | no
        Sets the Referer header to the directory name of the URL being
        requested (default=no).  This will add the Referer header if none is
        contained in the original request.  This option takes precedence over
        referer-self.

[<URL-SPEC>] referer-from = yes | no
        Removes the Referer header based on a match of the referring URL
        (default=no).

[<URL-SPEC>] force-user-agent = yes | no
        Forces a User-Agent header to be inserted into all requests that are
        made by WWWOFFLE (default=no).  This User-Agent is added only if there
        is not an existing User-Agent header and is set to the value
        WWWOFFLE/<version-number>.  This header is inserted before censoring
        and may be changed by the normal header censoring method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FTPOptions
----------

Options to use when fetching files using the ftp protocol.

anon-username = (string)
        The username to use for anonymous ftp (default=anonymous).

anon-password = (string)
        The password to use for anonymous ftp (default determined at run
        time).  If using a firewall then this may contain a value that is not
        valid to the FTP server and may need to be set to a different value.

<URL-SPEC> auth-username = (string)
        The username to use on a host instead of the default anonymous
        username.

<URL-SPEC> auth-password = (string)
        The password to use on a host instead of the default anonymous
        password.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MIMETypes
---------

MIME Types to use when serving files that were not fetched using HTTP or for
files on the built-in web-server.

default = (mime-type)/(subtype)
        The default MIME type (default=text/plain).

.(file-ext) = (mime-type)/(subtype)
        The MIME type to associate with a file extension.  The '.' must be
        included in the file extension.  If more than one extension matches
        then the longest one is used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxy
-----

This contains the names of the HTTP (or other) proxies to use external to the
WWWOFFLE server machine.

[<URL-SPEC>] proxy = (host[:port])
        The hostname and port on it to use as the proxy.

<URL-SPEC> auth-username = (string)
        The username to use on a proxy host to authenticate WWWOFFLE to it.
        The URL-SPEC in this case refers to the proxy and not the URL being
        retrieved.

<URL-SPEC> auth-password = (string)
        The password to use on a proxy host to authenticate WWWOFFLE to it.
        The URL-SPEC in this case refers to the proxy and not the URL being
        retrieved.

[<URL-SPEC>] ssl = (host[:port])
        A proxy server that should be used for https or Secure Socket Layer
        (SSL) connections.  Note that for the <URL-SPEC> that only the host is
        checked and that the other parts must be '*' WILDCARDs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alias
-----

A list of aliases that are used to replace the server name and path with
another server name and path.

URL-SPECIFICATION = URL-SPECIFICATION
        Any requests that match the first URL-SPECIFICATION are replaced by
        the second URL-SPECIFICATION.  The first URL-SPECIFICATION is a
        wildcard match for the protocol and host/port, the path must match the
        start of the requested URL exactly and includes all subdirectories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purge
-----

The method to determine which pages to purge, the default age the host
specific maximum age of the pages in days, and the maximum cache size.

use-mtime = yes | no
        The method to use to decide which files to purge, last access time
        (atime) or last modification time (mtime) (default=no).

max-size = (size)
        The maximum size for the cache in MB after purging (default=-1).  A
        maximum cache size of -1 (or 0 for backwards compatibility) means
        there is no limit to the size.  If this and the min-free options are
        both used the smaller cache size is chosen.  This option take into
        account the URLs that are never purged when measuring the cache size
        but will not purge them.

min-free = (size)
        The minimum amount of free disk space in MB after purging
        (default=-1).  A minimum disk free of -1 (or 0) means there is no
        limit to the free space.  If this and the max-size options are both
        used the smaller cache size is chosen.  This option take into account
        the URLs that are never purged when measuring the cache size but will
        not purge them.

use-url = yes | no
        If true then use the URL to decide on the purge age, otherwise use the
        protocol and host only (default=no).

del-dontget = yes | no
        If true then delete the URLs that match the entries in the DontGet
        section (default=no).

del-dontcache = yes | no
        If true then delete the URLs that match the entries in the DontCache
        section (default=no).

[<URL-SPEC>] age = (age)
        The maximum age in the cache for URLs that match this (default=14).
        An age of zero means always to delete, negative means not to delete.
        The URL-SPECIFICATION matches only the protocol and host unless
        use-url is set to true. Longer times can be specified with a 'w', 'm'
        or 'y' suffix for weeks, months or years (e.g. 2w=14).

[<URL-SPEC>] compress-age = (age)
        The maximum age in the cache for URLs that match this to be stored
        uncompressed (default=-1).  Requires zlib compilation option.  An age
        of zero means always to compress, negative means never to compress.
        The URL-SPECIFICATION matches only the protocol and host unless
        use-url is set to true. Longer times can be specified with a 'w', 'm'
        or 'y' suffix for weeks, months or years (e.g. 2w=14).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WILDCARD
--------

A WILDCARD match is one that uses the '*' character to represent any group of
characters.

This is basically the same as the command line file matching expressions in
DOS or the UNIX shell, except that the '*' can match the '/' character.

For example

*.gif       matches  foo.gif and bar.gif

*.foo.com   matches  www.foo.com and ftp.foo.com

/foo/*      matches  /foo/bar.html and /foo/bar/foobar.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

URL-SPECIFICATION
-----------------

When specifying a host and protocol and pathname in many of the sections a
URL-SPECIFICATION can be used, this is a way of recognising a URL.

For the purposes of this explanation a URL is considered to be made up of five
parts.

proto          The protocol that is used (e.g. 'http', 'ftp')

host           The server hostname (e.g. 'www.gedanken.demon.co.uk').

port           The port number on the host (e.g. default of 80 for HTTP).

path           The pathname on the host (e.g. '/bar.html') or a directory name
               (e.g. '/foo/').

args           Optional arguments with the URL used for CGI scripts etc.
               (e.g. 'search=foo').

For example the WWWOFFLE homepage: http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/
The protocol is 'http', the host is 'www.gedanken.demon.co.uk', the port is
the default (in this case 80), and the pathname is '/wwwoffle/'.

In general this is written as (proto)://(host)[:(port)]/[(path)][?(args)]

Where [] indicates an optional feature, and () indicate a user supplied name
or number.

Some example URL-SPECIFICATION options are the following:

*://*/*             Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Any path, Any args
                    (This is the default for options that can have a <URL-SPEC>
                    prefix when none is specified).

*://*/(path)        Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Named path, Any args

*://*/*?            Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Any path, No args

*://*/(path)?*      Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Named path, Any args

*://(host)          Any protocol, Named host, Any port, Any path, Any args

(proto)://*/*       Named proto, Any host, Any port, Any path, Any args

(proto)://(host)/*  Named proto, Named host, Any port, Any path, Any args

(proto)://(host):/* Named proto, Named host, Default port, Any path, Any args

*://(host):(port)/* Any protocol, Named host, Named port, Any path, Any args

The matching of the host, the path and the args use the WILDCARD matching that
is described above.  The matching of the path has the special condition that a
WILDCARD of '/*/foo' will match '/foo' and '/any/path/foo', in other words it
matches any path prefix.

In some sections that accept URL-SPECIFICATIONs they can be negated by
inserting the '!' character before it.  This will mean that the comparison
of a URL with the URL-SPECIFICATION will return the logically opposite value
to what would be returned without the '!'.  If all of the URL-SPECIFICATIONs
in a section are negated and '*://*/*' is added to the end then the sense of
the whole section is negated.

In all sections that accept URL-SPECIFICATIONs the comparison can be made case
insensitive for the path and arguments part by inserting the '~' character
before it.  (The host and the protocol comparisons are always case
insensitive).
