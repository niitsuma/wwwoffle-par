.SH NAME

wwwoffle.conf \- The configuration file for the proxy server for the World Wide Web Offline Explorer.


.SH Introduction

The configuration file (
.I wwwoffle\.conf
) specifies all of the parameters that
control the operation of the proxy server\.  The file is split into sections
each containing a series of parameters as described below\.  The file
.I CHANGES\.CONF
explains the changes in the configuration file between this
version of the program and previous ones\.
.LP
The file is split into sections, each of which can be empty or contain one or
more lines of configuration information\.  The sections are named and the order
that they appear in the file is not important\.
.LP
The general format of each of the sections is the same\.  The name of the
section is on a line by itself to mark the start\.  The contents of the section
are enclosed between a pair of lines containing only the \'{\' and \'}\'
characters or the \'[\' and \']\' characters\.  When the \'{\' and \'}\' characters are
used the lines between contain configuration information\.  When the \'[\' and
\']\' characters are used then there must only be a single non\-empty line
between them that contains the name of a file (in the same directory)
containing the configuration information for the section\.
.LP
Comments are marked by a \'#\' character at the start of the line and they are
ignored\.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored\.
.LP
The phrases 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
(or 
.I URL\-SPEC
for short) and 
.I WILDCARD
have
specific meanings in the configuration file and are described at the end\.  Any
item enclosed in \'(\' and \')\' in the descriptions means that it is a parameter
supplied by the user, anything enclosed in \'[\' and \']\' is optional, the \'|\'
symbol is used to denote alternate choices\.  Some options apply to specific
URLs only, this is indicated by having a 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
enclosed between
\'<\' & \'>\' in the option, the first 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
to match is used\.  If no
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
is given then it matches all URLs\.

.SH StartUp

This contains the parameters that are used when the program starts, changes to
these are ignored if the configuration file is re\-read while the program is
running\.
.TP
.B bind\-ipv4 = (hostname) | (ip\-address) | none
Specify the hostname or IP address to bind the HTTP proxy and WWWOFFLE
control port sockets to using IPv4 (default=\'0\.0\.0\.0\')\.  If \'none\' is
specified then no IPv4 socket is bound\.  If this is changed from the
default value then the first entry in the LocalHost section may need
to be changed to match\.
.TP
.B bind\-ipv6 = (hostname) | (ip\-address) | none
Specify the hostname or IP address to bind the HTTP proxy and WWWOFFLE
control port sockets to using IPv6 (default=\'::\')\.  If \'none\' is

compilation option\.  If this is changed from the default value then
the first entry in the LocalHost section may need to be changed to
match\.

.SH OnlineOptions

Options that control how WWWOFFLE behaves when it is online\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] pragma\-no\-cache = yes | no
Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
has \'Pragma: no\-cache\' (default=yes)\.  This option takes precedence
over the request\-changed and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] cache\-control\-no\-cache = yes | no
Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
has \'Cache\-Control: no\-cache\' (default=yes)\.  This option takes
precedence over the request\-changed and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] cache\-control\-max\-age\-0 = yes | no
Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
has \'Cache\-Control: max\-age=0\' (default=yes)\.  This option takes
precedence over the request\-changed and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] cookies\-force\-refresh = yes | no
Whether to force the refresh of a page if the request from the client
contains a cookie (default=no)\.  This option takes precedence over
the request\-changed and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-changed = (time)
While online pages will only be fetched if the cached version is older
than this specified time in seconds (default=600)\.  Setting this value
negative will indicate that cached pages are always used while online\.
Longer times can be specified with a \'m\', \'h\', \'d\' or \'w\' suffix for
minutes, hours, days or weeks (e\.g\. 10m=600)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-changed\-once = yes | no
While online pages will only be fetched if the cached version has not
already been fetched once this session online (default=yes)\.  This
option takes precedence over the request\-changed option\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-expired = yes | no
While online pages that have expired will always be requested again
(default=no)\.  This option takes precedence over the request\-changed
and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-no\-cache = yes | no
While online pages that ask not to be cached will always be requested
again (default=no)\.  This option takes precedence over the
request\-changed and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-redirection = yes | no
While online pages that redirect the client to another URL temporarily
will be requested again\. (default=no)\.  This option takes precedence
over the request\-changed and request\-changed\-once options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-conditional = yes | no
While online pages that are requested from the server will be
conditional requests so that server only sends data if the page has
changed (default=yes)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] validate\-with\-etag = yes | no
If WWWOFFLE should always use ETag headers (if present) when a page
is requested, and a copy exists in the cache (default=yes)\.
This could cause pages/images to be re\-fetched almost each time
WWWOFFLE verifies their validity with the origin server\. If they are
hosted on a pool of servers that use different ETags for the same
entity (which, unfortunately is often) it is highly possible\.
If set to no, WWWOFFLE will determine if the "Last\-Modified" header
is strong enough to be used alone\.
(This option was originally designed by Marc Boucher who called it
"always\-use\-etag"\.)
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] try\-without\-password = yes | no
If a request is made for a URL that contains a username and password
then a request is made for the same URL without a username and
password specified (default=yes)\.  This allows for requests for the
URL without a password to re\-direct the client to the passworded
version\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] intr\-download\-keep = yes | no
If the client closes the connection while online the currently
downloaded incomplete page should be kept (default=no)\.
.TP

If the client closes the connection while online the page should
continue to download if it is smaller than this size in kB
(default=1)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] intr\-download\-percent = (integer)
If the client closes the connection while online the page should
continue to download if it is more than this percentage complete
(default=80)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] timeout\-download\-keep = yes | no
If the server connection times out while reading then the currently
downloaded incomplete page should be kept (default=no)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] keep\-cache\-if\-not\-found = yes | no
If the remote server replies with an error message or a redirection
while there is a cached version with status 200 the previously cached 
version should be kept (default=no)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] keep\-cache\-if\-header\-matches = (string)
This option is similar to keep\-cache\-if\-not\-found, but instead of
looking at the status code of the reply from the remote server,
the header lines of the reply are matched against the given string\.
The string is interpreted as a pattern and may contain \'*\' 
.I WILDCARD
s\.
If the string contains a \':\', the part before the first \':\' is matched
against the keys, and the rest against the values of the header lines\.
If the string doesn\'t contain a \':\', only the keys of the header lines
are matched against the string\. The comparison is case insensitive\.
If a match is found and there is a cached version of the page with
status 200 that doesn\'t match the pattern string, the previously 
cached version is kept\.
(Option added by Paul Rombouts\.)
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-compressed\-data = yes | no | deflate | gzip
If the requests that are made to the server are to request compressed
data (default=yes)\.  Requires zlib compilation option\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] request\-chunked\-data = yes | no
If the requests that are made to the server are to request chunked
encoding (default=yes)\.

\'no\' if when browsing offline all pages are re\-requested by a \'broken\'
browser\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] cache\-control\-no\-cache = yes | no
Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the
client has \'Cache\-Control: no\-cache\' (default=yes)\.
This option can be set to \'no\' for certain URL\-specs to
reduce the number of outgoing requests that are generated by a
\'broken\' browser\.
This option was added by Paul Rombouts\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] cache\-control\-max\-age\-0 = yes | no
Whether to request a new copy of a page if the request from the client
has \'Cache\-Control: max\-age=0\' (default=yes)\.  This option should be
set to \'no\' if when browsing offline all pages are re\-requested by a
\'broken\' browser\.
.TP

option should be set to *:443 to allow https to the default port number\.
There can be more than one option for other ports or hosts as required\.
This option takes precedence over the allow\-cache option\.
.TP
.B disallow\-tunnel = (host[:port])
A hostname and port number (a 
.I WILDCARD
match) for an SSL server that can
not be connected to using WWWOFFLE as a tunnelling proxy\.  There can be

This is so that the proxy does not need to contact itself if the request has a
different name for the same server\.
.TP
.B (host)
A hostname or IP address that in connection with the port number (in
the StartUp section) specifies the WWWOFFLE proxy HTTP server\.  The
hostnames must match exactly, it is not a 
.I WILDCARD
match\.  The first

cached by WWWOFFLE\.  The host name matching uses 
.I WILDCARD
s\.  A host
can be excluded by appending a \'!\' to the start of the name, all
possible aliases and IP addresses for the host are also required\.  All
entries here are assumed to be reachable even when offline\.  None of
the hosts named here are cached or fetched via a proxy\.

.SH AllowedConnectHosts

A list of client hostnames that are allowed to connect to the server\.
.TP
.B (host)
A hostname or IP address that is allowed to connect to the server\.
The host name matching uses 
.I WILDCARD
s\.  A host can be excluded by
appending a \'!\' to the start of the name, all possible aliases and IP
addresses for the host are also required\.  All of the hosts named in
LocalHost are also allowed to connect\.

.SH AllowedConnectUsers

A list of the users that are allowed to connect to the server and their
passwords\.
.TP
.B (username):(password)
The username and password of the users that are allowed to connect to
the server\.  If this section is left empty then no user authentication
is done\.  The username and password are both stored in plaintext
format\.  This requires the use of clients that handle the HTTP/1\.1
proxy authentication standard\.

.SH DontCache

A list of URLs that are not to be cached by WWWOFFLE\.
.TP
.B [!]URL\-SPECIFICATION
Do not cache any URLs that match this\.  The 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
can be
negated to allow matches to be cached\.  The URLs that are not cached
will not be requested if offline\.

.SH DontGet

A list of URLs that are not to be got by WWWOFFLE when it is fetching and not
to be served from the WWWOFFLE cache even if they exist\.
.TP
.B [!]URL\-SPECIFICATION
Do not get any URLs that match this\.  The 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
can be
negated to allow matches to be got\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] replacement = (URL)
The URL to use to replace any URLs that match the 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
s
instead of using the standard error message (default=none)\.  The URLs
in /local/dontget/ are suggested replacements (e\.g\. replacement\.gif or
replacement\.png which are 1x1 pixel transparent images or
replacement\.js which is an empty javascript file)\.
.TP
.B <URL\-SPEC> get\-recursive = yes | no
Choose whether to get URLs that match this when doing a recursive
fetch (default=yes)\.
.TP
.B <URL\-SPEC> location\-error = yes | no
When a URL reply contains a \'Location\' header that redirects to a URL
that is not got (specified in this section) then the reply is modified
to be an error message instead (default=no)\.  This will stop ISP
proxies from redirecting users to adverts if the advert URLs are
in this section\.

.SH DontCompress

A list of MIME types and file extensions that are not to be compressed by
WWWOFFLE (because they are already compressed or not not worth compressing)\.
Requires zlib compilation option\.
.TP
.B mime\-type = (mime\-type)/(subtype)
The MIME type of a URL that is not to be compressed in the cache or
when providing compressed pages to clients\.
.TP
.B file\-ext = \.(file\-ext)
The file extension of a URL that is not to be requested compressed
from a server\.

.SH CensorIncomingHeader

A list of HTTP header lines that are to be removed from the replies that come
back from web servers\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] (header) = yes | no | (string)
A header field name (e\.g\. Set\-Cookie) and
the string to replace the header value with (default=no)\.  The header
is case sensitive, and does not have a \':\' at the end\.  The value of
"no" means that the header is unmodified, "yes" or no string can be
used to remove the header or a string can be used to replace the
header\.  This only replaces headers it finds, it does not add any new
ones\.  An option for Set\-Cookie here will take precedence over the
session\-cookies\-only option\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] session\-cookies\-only = yes | no
Choose whether to delete the "expires" field from "Set\-Cookie:" server
headers (default=no)\.  Most browsers will not store such cookies
permanently and forget them in between sessions\.
This option was added by Paul Rombouts (who got the idea from Privoxy)\.

.SH CensorOutgoingHeader

A list of HTTP header lines that are to be removed from the requests sent to
web servers\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] (header) = yes | no | (string)
A header field name (e\.g\. From, Cookie, User\-Agent) and
the string to replace the header value with (default=no)\.  The header
is case sensitive, and does not have a \':\' at the end\.  The value of
"no" means that the header is unmodified, "yes" or no string can be
used to remove the header or a string can be used to replace the
header\.  This only replaces headers it finds, it does not add any new
ones\.  An option for Referer here will take precedence over the
referer\-self and referer\-self\-dir options\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] referer\-self = yes | no
Sets the Referer header to the same as the URL being requested
(default=no)\.  This will add the Referer header if none is contained
in the original request\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] referer\-self\-dir = yes | no
Sets the Referer header to the directory name of the URL being
requested (default=no)\.  This will add the Referer header if none is
contained in the original request\.  This option takes precedence over
referer\-self\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] force\-user\-agent = yes | no
Forces a User\-Agent header to be inserted into all requests that are
made by WWWOFFLE (default=no)\.  This User\-Agent is added only if there
is not an existing User\-Agent header and is set to the value
WWWOFFLE/<version\-number>\.  This header is inserted before censoring
and may be changed by the normal header censoring method\.

.SH FTPOptions

Options to use when fetching files using the ftp protocol\.
.TP
.B anon\-username = (string)
The username to use for anonymous ftp (default=anonymous)\.
.TP
.B anon\-password = (string)
The password to use for anonymous ftp (default determined at run
time)\.  If using a firewall then this may contain a value that is not
valid to the FTP server and may need to be set to a different value\.
.TP
.B <URL\-SPEC> auth\-username = (string)
The username to use on a host instead of the default anonymous
username\.
.TP
.B <URL\-SPEC> auth\-password = (string)
The password to use on a host instead of the default anonymous
password\.

.SH MIMETypes

MIME Types to use when serving files that were not fetched using HTTP or for
files on the built\-in web\-server\.
.TP
.B default = (mime\-type)/(subtype)
The default MIME type (default=text/plain)\.
.TP
.B \.(file\-ext) = (mime\-type)/(subtype)
The MIME type to associate with a file extension\.  The \'\.\' must be
included in the file extension\.  If more than one extension matches
then the longest one is used\.

.SH Proxy

This contains the names of the HTTP (or other) proxies to use external to the
WWWOFFLE server machine\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] proxy = (host[:port])
The hostname and port on it to use as the proxy\.
.TP
.B <URL\-SPEC> auth\-username = (string)
The username to use on a proxy host to authenticate WWWOFFLE to it\.
The 
.I URL\-SPEC
in this case refers to the proxy and not the URL being
retrieved\.
.TP
.B <URL\-SPEC> auth\-password = (string)
The password to use on a proxy host to authenticate WWWOFFLE to it\.
The 
.I URL\-SPEC
in this case refers to the proxy and not the URL being
retrieved\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] socks = (host[:port])
The hostname and port to use as a SOCKS 4 proxy (default: none)\.
(Option added by Paul Rombouts\.)
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] socks\-remote\-dns = yes | no
By default, when connecting through a SOCKS proxy server the destination
host name is resolved locally and the IP address is given to the SOCKS
server\. Sometimes this is not what you want\. When this option is
enabled, WWWOFFLE will not attempt to resolve the name and will supply
the host name directly to the SOCKS server\. This option only works if
the SOCKS server supports the SOCKS 4A protocol\.
(Option added by Paul Rombouts\.)
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] ssl = (host[:port])
A proxy server that should be used for Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
connections e\.g\. https\.  Note that for the 
.I <URL\-SPEC>
that only the
host is checked and that the other parts must be \'*\' 
.I WILDCARD
s\.

.SH Alias

A list of aliases that are used to replace the server name and path with
another server name and path\.
.TP
.B URL\-SPECIFICATION = URL\-SPECIFICATION
Any requests that match the first 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
are replaced by
the second 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION.
The first 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
is a
wildcard match for the protocol and host/port, the path must match the
start of the requested URL exactly and includes all subdirectories\.

.SH Purge

The method to determine which pages to purge, the default age the host
specific maximum age of the pages in days, and the maximum cache size\.
.TP
.B use\-mtime = yes | no
The method to use to decide which files to purge, last access time
(atime) or last modification time (mtime) (default=no)\.
.TP
.B max\-size = (size)
The maximum size for the cache in MB after purging (default=\-1)\.  A
maximum cache size of \-1 (or 0 for backwards compatibility) means
there is no limit to the size\.  If this and the min\-free options are
both used the smaller cache size is chosen\.  This option take into
account the URLs that are never purged when measuring the cache size
but will not purge them\.
.TP
.B min\-free = (size)
The minimum amount of free disk space in MB after purging
(default=\-1)\.  A minimum disk free of \-1 (or 0) means there is no
limit to the free space\.  If this and the max\-size options are both
used the smaller cache size is chosen\.  This option take into account
the URLs that are never purged when measuring the cache size but will
not purge them\.
.TP
.B use\-url = yes | no
If true then use the URL to decide on the purge age, otherwise use the
protocol and host only (default=no)\.
.TP
.B del\-dontget = yes | no
If true then delete the URLs that match the entries in the DontGet
section (default=no)\.
.TP
.B del\-dontcache = yes | no
If true then delete the URLs that match the entries in the DontCache
section (default=no)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] age = (age)
The maximum age in the cache for URLs that match this (default=14)\.
An age of zero means always to delete, negative means not to delete\.
The 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
matches only the protocol and host unless
use\-url is set to true\. Longer times can be specified with a \'w\', \'m\'
or \'y\' suffix for weeks, months or years (e\.g\. 2w=14)\.
.TP
.B [<URL\-SPEC>] compress\-age = (age)
The maximum age in the cache for URLs that match this to be stored
uncompressed (default=\-1)\.  Requires zlib compilation option\.  An age
of zero means always to compress, negative means never to compress\.
The 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
matches only the protocol and host unless
use\-url is set to true\. Longer times can be specified with a \'w\', \'m\'
or \'y\' suffix for weeks, months or years (e\.g\. 2w=14)\.

.SH WILDCARD

A 
.I WILDCARD
match is one that uses the \'*\' character to represent any group of
characters\.
.LP
This is basically the same as the command line file matching expressions in
DOS or the UNIX shell, except that the \'*\' can match the \'/\' character\.
.LP
For example
.TP
.B *.gif
matches  foo.gif and bar.gif
.TP
.B *.foo.com
matches  www.foo.com and ftp.foo.com
.TP
.B /foo/*
matches  /foo/bar.html and /foo/bar/foobar.html

.SH URL-SPECIFICATION

When specifying a host and protocol and pathname in many of the sections a
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
can be used, this is a way of recognising a URL\.
.LP
For the purposes of this explanation a URL is considered to be made up of five
parts\.
.TP
.B proto
The protocol that is used (e.g. 'http', 'ftp')
.TP
.B host
The server hostname (e.g. 'www.gedanken.demon.co.uk').
.TP
.B port
The port number on the host (e.g. default of 80 for HTTP).
.TP
.B path
The pathname on the host (e.g. '/bar.html') or a directory name
(e\.g\. \'/foo/\')\.
.TP
.B args
Optional arguments with the URL used for CGI scripts etc.
(e\.g\. \'search=foo\')\.
.LP
For example the WWWOFFLE homepage: http://www\.gedanken\.demon\.co\.uk/wwwoffle/
The protocol is \'http\', the host is \'www\.gedanken\.demon\.co\.uk\', the port is
the default (in this case 80), and the pathname is \'/wwwoffle/\'\.
.LP
In general this is written as (proto)://(host)[:(port)]/[(path)][?(args)]
.LP
Where [] indicates an optional feature, and () indicate a user supplied name
or number\.
.LP
Some example 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
options are the following:
.TP
.B *://*/*
Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Any path, Any args
(This is that same as saying \'default\')\.
.TP
.B *://*/(path)
Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Named path, Any args
.TP
.B *://*/*?
Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Any path, No args
.TP
.B *://*/(path)?*
Any protocol, Any host, Any port, Named path, Any args
.TP
.B *://(host)
Any protocol, Named host, Any port, Any path, Any args
.TP
.B (proto)://*/*
Named proto, Any host, Any port, Any path, Any args
.LP
(proto)://(host)/*  Named proto, Named host, Any port, Any path, Any args
.LP
(proto)://(host):/* Named proto, Named host, Default port, Any path, Any args
.LP
*://(host):(port)/* Any protocol, Named host, Named port, Any path, Any args
.LP
The matching of the host, the path and the args use the 
.I WILDCARD
matching that
is described above\.  The matching of the path has the special condition that a
.I WILDCARD
of \'/*/foo\' will match \'/foo\' and \'/any/path/foo\', in other words it
matches any path prefix\.
.LP
In some sections that accept 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
s they can be negated by
inserting the \'!\' character before it\.  This will mean that the comparison
of a URL with the 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
will return the logically opposite value
to what would be returned without the \'!\'\.  If all of the 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
s
in a section are negated and \'*://*/*\' is added to the end then the sense of
the whole section is negated\.
.LP
In all sections that accept 
.I URL\-SPECIFICATION
s the comparison can be made case
insensitive for the path and arguments part by inserting the \'~\' character
before it\.  (The host and the protocol comparisons are always case
insensitive)\.
