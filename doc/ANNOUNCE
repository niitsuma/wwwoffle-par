Changes
-------

Since version 2.7g:

Bug Fixes:
 Have more verbose error messages for invalid POST requests.  Fix the way the
 upgrade-config script handles the no-lasttime-index to create-history-indexes
 change.  Change the way that the user selects to view request headers on the
 info pages.  Handle Accept-Language header more robustly.


*NOTE* This version contains some security related fixes and should be used in
       preference to earlier versions.
