Changes
-------

Since version 2.7f:

Bug Fixes:
 When modifying HTML links to same page are displayed as cached.  Only censor
 headers for SSL if using another proxy.  Don't refetch FTP files of the same
 date as cached one.  Change some HTTP error codes to 500 instead of 200.
 Insert empty ALT tags when removing images.  Delete zero length cached files
 when requested offline.  Fix parsing of '-c' option in wwwoffle-tools.

New Features:
 Added a cache-control-no-cache option which works like pragma-no-cache.
 Renamed no-lasttime-index to create-history-indexes and reversed its meaning.
 If a CGI returns a HTTP status line at the top then keep it.
 Added some web pages that will show the headers and content of cached pages.
 Allow -1 to be used for max-size and min-free to ignore the options.
 Write the unmodified header from the server to the cache when online.


*NOTE* The URL for the URL specific index has changed.
       Instead of '/index/url/?xxx' it is '/index/url?xxx'.

*NOTE* The URL for configuration page editing a specific URL has changed.
       Instead of '/configuration/xxx?url=yyy' it is '/configuration/xxx?yyy'.

*NOTE* A lot of the message pages have been modified, if any of the WWWOFFLE
       generated HTML pages look different it may be a bug has been introduced.
