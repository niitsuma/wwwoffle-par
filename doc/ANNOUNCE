Changes
-------

Since version 2.9a:

Bug Fixes:
 Fix some string allocations.  Don't delete the lasttime cached spool file if
 page was fetched in this session.  Fix HTML parsing of '\' inside or outside
 quoted strings.  Make sure that files are truncated when opened.  Display
 non-empty value in monitor page hour-of-day setting for default value.  Some
 documentation updates.

New Features:
 Expired SSL certificates are deleted and replaced.


*NOTE* *This only applies if WWWOFFLE is compiled with SSL/https support*
       WWWOFFLE creates SSL certificates with a 1 year expiry period.  When they
       expire web browsers will start to give errors.  If the WWWOFFLE root
       Certificate Authority certificate expires then all sites will give SSL
       errors.  Deleting the existing WWWOFFLE CA certificate from the browser
       and installing the new one will fix this problem (the WWWOFFLE CA
       certificate can be loaded from https://localhost:8443/certificates/root).
