Changes
-------

Since version 2.8:

Bug Fixes:
 When modifying HTML check cache status of link aliases.  Fix an error message
 when executing a change mode script.
 Fix URL encoding in index pages.  Remove warnings compiling with CYGWIN.  Make
 the ssl-allow-port config file option work for port 80.  If confirm-requests is
 enabled don't allow POST/PUT.  Warn if timestamp of monitored file cannot be
 changed.  Remove fake URL arguments from aliased URL for POST/PUT.  Print
 internal page headers in ExtraDebug mode.  'wwwoffle -fetch' works in autodial
 mode.  Avoid config editing pages being cached by browser.  Be more consistent
 with removing '#' from URLs in all cases.  Handle URLs with URL-encoded
 hostnames.  Handle purge with age=-1 and min-free or max-size set.  Break
 socket writes into small pieces for huge data blocks.  Purge from lasttime and
 prevtime if URL purged from main cache.

Internal Code Changes:
 Lots of internal modifications to remove years of accumulated ugliness.
 Source code changes to increase speed and reduce memory size.
 Use 'const' for fixed data arrays and function parameters where possible.
 Be careful with integer variables on systems where sizeof(long)!=sizeof(int).
 Reduce code size if compiling without zlib option.

New Features:
 Add a new layer of buffering to avoid large number of small network writes.
 Add checkboxes to protocol indexes (e.g. /index/http) for deleting multiple.
 Add reset button (and more if javascript) to clear delete checkboxes.
 Add the ability to use the Hyper Estraier programs to search the cache.
 Improve the purge output, print more information about what is happening.

Programs:
 Move the convert-cache and uncompress-cache functions into wwwoffle-tools.

Documentation:
 Remove the file called CONVERT and all references to ancient WWWOFFLE versions.
 Add new documentation about Hyper Estraier and update other search documents.
 Tidy the README.1st file.


*NOTE* The configure script will enable IPv6 by default if possible.
       If you explicitly want it disabled you must do this yourself.

*NOTE* The URLs for deleting cached web pages has changed.
       For example '/control/delete-url/?xxx' is now '/control/delete/url?xxx'.

*NOTE* The HTML message files no longer have 'localhost' defined, but 'localurl'
       is used instead (http://$localhost/ -> $localurl/).


Since version 2.9-beta:

Bug Fixes:
 Fix configure script AC_INIT and tests for sys/mount.h.  Block more Javascript
 when modifying HTML.  Don't change the URL hash for a POST request when
 fetching it.  Don't handle parameter separately from path in URL.  Don't split
 up large writes when no timeout is set.

Internal Code Changes:
 More changes for integer variables on systems where sizeof(long)!=sizeof(int).
 Change the configure_io_*() functions for each type of IO not each direction.

New Features:
 Added ability to make secure browser connection to WWWOFFLE using HTTPS.
 Added ability to cache SSL connection data (https) (config file options).
 Added a page to show information about the SSL certificates stored by WWWOFFLE.

Documentation:
 Add new documentation about HTTPS SSL/TLS security, trust and WWWOFFLE.


*NOTE* If you want to enable HTTPS/SSL functions in WWWOFFLE you must enable it
       when running configure prior to compiling.  It is not enabled by default.

*NOTE* If you have compiled WWWOFFLE with gnutls there will be a delay the first
       time that wwwoffled is started and the first time each https server is
       accessed due to the creation of secure encryption keys.


Since version 2.9-beta-ssl:

Bug Fixes:
 Fix script removal tag attribute confusion.  Fix cygwin handling of certificate
 filenames.  Fix audit-usage.pl so that it works with syslog output.  Make sure
 trusted certificates have valid dates.  Detect and fetch background images in
 table cells.  Lower the logging level of some unimportant warning messages.

New Features:
 Added an option 'cookies-force-refresh' so requests with cookies are refreshed.
