          WWWOFFLE - World Wide Web Offline Explorer - Version 2.9
          ========================================================

The configuration file 'wwwoffle.conf' has had a number of changes made to it in
recent versions.  This file lists the conversion that you need to apply to
convert existing configuration files (from version 1.3 onwards) to make them
work with the current version.

More details about any of the sections in the configuration file can be found in
the README.CONF file.


Automatic Configuration File Upgrading [Requires Perl]
======================================

The configuration file can be automatically changed by using the supplied perl
script upgrade-config.pl.  This makes any changes from version 2.6 to the latest
version, other programs can make changes from any version 2.x config files, but
not from a version 1.x config file.

  Usage: upgrade-config.pl [(conf-dir)/]wwwoffle.conf

The named configuration file is moved to wwwoffle.conf.old in the same directory
and a new file of the same name is created that contains the updated
configuration options.  If there is a file called wwwoffle.conf.install in
either the current directory or in the configuration directory (as there will be
if you do a 'make install') then the comments from that file are used in the new
file, otherwise no comments are used as they would be wrong and confusing.

Changes From Version 2.1 to Version 2.2

Note: The 'fetch-images' and 'fetch-frames' options are moved from the Options
      section to the FetchOptions section and renamed 'images' and 'frames'.

Changes From Version 2.0 to Version 2.1
=======================================

Note: The configuration parser is more fussy about having the correct types,
      previously a non-integer was allowed where an integer was expected etc.

Note: In the DontCache, DontGet, DontGetRecursive, Proxy and Purge sections the
      presence of a port number ( proto/host:port ) must match, a ':' with no
      port number is a wildcard and matches any port.  See the README.CONF file
      in the HOST-SPECIFICATION section for more details.
