            WWWOFFLE - World Wide Web Offline Explorer - Version 2.9
            ========================================================


The program Hyper Estraier is a free (LGPL) text indexing and search program.

        Hyper Estraier is a full-text search system.  You can search lots of
        documents for some documents including specified words.  If you run a
        web site, it is useful as your own search engine for pages in your site.
        Also, it is useful as search utilities of mail boxes and file
        servers.

Hyper Estraier can be used to search files of many different sorts, including
HTML files.  There are lots of ways that the files can get into Hyper Estraier,
but the one used with WWWOFFLE is to read the cache directly.


Getting Hyper Estraier
----------------------

Hyper Estraier is available from the web site

      http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/

You need to have version 0.5.7 or later to have support for indexing the
WWWOFFLE cache.  (Back to version 0.5.3 it worked, but did not index all cached
pages).

No special compile-time configuration of Hyper Estraier is required to be able
to use it with WWWOFFLE.


I tested with version 0.9.0 using the official Debian package.


Configure WWWOFFLE to run with Hyper Estraier
---------------------------------------------

The configuration files for the Hyper Estraier programs as used with WWWOFFLE
will have been installed in /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/hyperestraier/conf when
WWWOFFLE was installed.  The scripts used to run the Hyper Estraier programs
will have been installed in /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/hyperestraier/scripts
when WWWOFFLE was installed.  In both these cases the directory
/var/spool/wwwoffle can be changed at compile time with options to the configure
script.

These files should be correct if the information at the time of running
configure was set correctly.  Check them, they should have the spool directory
set correctly.

Also they should be checked to ensure that the Hyper Estraier and wwwoffle-ls
programs are on the path (you can edit the PATH variable here if they are not in
/usr/local/bin).


Indexing
--------

Indexing is the name that is given to the process of searching through the
web-pages to make the search database.

To work with WWWOFFLE I have produced my own scripts that should be used
to call the Hyper Estraier indexer progam (estcmd).

   /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/hyperestraier/scripts/wwwoffle-estcmd-full

This script will do a full search and index all of the HTTP URLs in the cache.


Searching
---------

The search page for using Hyper Estraier with WWWOFFLE is
http://localhost:8080/search/hyperestraier/ and is linked to from the "Welcome
Page".  The word or words that you want to search for should be entered here.

This form actually calls the script

   /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/hyperestraier/scripts/wwwoffle-estseek

to do the searching so it is possible to edit this to modify it if required.

Thanks to Mikio Hirabayashi <mikio@users.sourceforge.net> for writing the Hyper
Estraier and making it work with WWWOFFLE.
