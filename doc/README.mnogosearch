          WWWOFFLE - World Wide Web Offline Explorer - Version 2.9
          ========================================================


The progam mnoGoSearch (formally known as UdmSearch) is a free (GPL) internet
indexing and search program.  The mnoGoSearch web-page describes itself as
follows:

        mnoGoSearch (formerly known as UdmSearch) is a full-featured search
        software for intranet and internet servers. mnoGoSearch is a free
        software covered by the GNU General Public License.

        mnoGoSearch software has a number of unique features, which makes it
        appropriate for a wide range of applications from search within your
        site to specialized search systems such as cooking recipes or newspaper
        searches, ftp archive search, MP3 search, news articles search or even
        national-wide portal search engine.

I have written WWWOFFLE so that mnoGoSearch can be used with it to allow the
entire cache of pages can be indexed.  There are three stages to using the
program that are described in this document; installation, indexing and
searching.


Installing mnoGoSearch
----------------------

mnoGoSearch is available from the web site

        http://mnogosearch.org/

You need to have version 3.1.0 or later of mnoGoSearch.

No special compile-time configuration of mnoGoSearch is required to be able to
use it with WWWOFFLE.


I tested with version 3.1.0.


Configure WWWOFFLE to run with mnoGoSearch
------------------------------------------

The configuration files for the mnoGoSearch programs as used with WWWOFFLE will
have been installed in /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/mnogosearch/conf when WWWOFFLE
was installed.  The scripts used to run the mnoGoSearch programs will have been
installed in /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/mnoGoSearch/scripts when WWWOFFLE was
installed.  In both these cases the directory /var/spool/wwwoffle can be changed
at compile time with options to the configure script.

These files should be correct if the information at the time of running
configure was set correctly.  Check them, they should have the spool directory
and the proxy hostname and port set correctly.

Also they should be checked to ensure that the mnoGoSearch programs are on the
path (you can edit the PATH variable here if they are not in /usr/local/bin).


Configure database to work with mnoGoSearch
-------------------------------------------

MySQL
- - -

Create the MySQL database using the 'mysqladmin' command

$ mysqladmin create mnogosearch

Setup the database structure for the mnoGoSearch database.

$ mysql mnogosearch < mnogosearch-3.1.13/create/mysql/create.txt
$ mysql mnogosearch < mnogosearch-3.1.13/create/mysql/crc-multi.txt

Create the MySQL user called wwwoffle and allow access to the mnogosearch
database.  This requires running the mysql program and entering commands at the
'mysql>' prompt (I have broken up the second line to allow it to fit, it should
all be one line).

$ mysql -u root mysql

mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password) VALUES('localhost','wwwoffle','');
mysql> INSERT INTO db (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,
       Delete_priv,Create_priv,Drop_priv)
       VALUES('localhost','mnogosearch','wwwoffle','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> quit


Postgres SQL
- - - - - -

The Postgres database server needs to be configured so that it users TCP/IP and
so that access is allowed from the host that the udmsearch program will be run
from.

The option PGALLOWTCPIP=yes in postmaster.init needs to be set to allow TCP/IP
access.

The options PGFSYNC=no in postmaster.init needs to be set to get good
performance.

You will need to create a database user and set up the database for mnoGoSearch.

$ createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser wwwoffle
$ createdb -U wwwoffle mnogosearch

Setup the database structure for the mnogosearch database.

$ psql -U wwwoffle mnogosearch < mnogosearch-3.1.13/create/pgsql/create.txt
$ psql -U wwwoffle mnogosearch < mnogosearch-3.1.13/create/pgsql/crc-multi.txt


Indexing
--------

Indexing is the name that is given to the process of searching through the
web-pages to make the search database.

To work with WWWOFFLE I have produced my own scripts that should be used
to call the mnoGoSearch indexer.

   /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/mnogosearch/scripts/wwwoffle-mnogosearch-full
   /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/mnogosearch/scripts/wwwoffle-mnogosearch-lasttime

The first of these scripts will do a full search and index all of the URLs in
the cache.  The second one will do a search of the URLs in the lasttime
directory.


Searching
---------

The search page for mnoGoSearch is at http://localhost:8080/search/mnogosearch/
and is linked to from the "Welcome Page".  The word or words that you want to
search for should be entered here.

This form actually calls the script

   /var/spool/wwwoffle/search/mnogosearch/scripts/wwwoffle-mnogosearch

to do the searching so it is possible to edit this to modify it if required.


Thanks to
---------

Thanks to Volker Wysk <vw@volker-wysk.de> for providing the initial information
about using mnoGoSearch.  I have used his useful e-mail about how to configure
the mnoGoSearch program and MySQL in this document (with modifications).
