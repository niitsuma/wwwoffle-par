The first of these files is a project file for the Setup Generator program
produced by Gentee Inc.  The program is freeware and can be downloaded from
http://www.gentee.com/.  This program creates a self-extracting executable that
will automatically install a program and configure Windows.

The second of these files is a program that is used to set the paths in the
batch files and wwwoffle.conf file.  It is run by the automatic installer after
the files have been installed.
