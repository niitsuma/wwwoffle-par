  <H1>Dan Jacobson's WWWOFFLE and ppp tools</H1>

  <P>Dan Jacobson has made several tools for WWWOFFLE and ppp,
  which may be found on <A
   href=
  "http://jidanni.org/comp/wwwoffle/">http://jidanni.org/comp/wwwoffle/</A>,</P>

  <UL>
   <LI>
    <H2>WWWOFFLE tools</H2>

    <P>These are some tools that I made for <A
     href="http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/">WWWOFFLE</A>
    [World Wide Web Offline Explorer] that seem handy. They at
    least work with WWWOFFLE Version 2.7</P>

    <UL>
     <LI>
      Needn't be root to use 

      <UL>
       <LI><CODE>wwwoffle-chunks</CODE> -- chop a WWWOFFLE index
       into smaller chunks -- else no fun each time I hit the BACK
       key. Also if one doesn't read their e.g. Last Time indexes
       before they get pushed off the back of the accessible list,
       this will keep it around until you get around to reading
       it.</LI>

      Must be root to use 

      <UL>
       <LI><CODE>wwwoffle-outgoing-regexp-rm</CODE> -- remove
       WWWOFFLE outgoing requests via regular expression -- as
       often one wishes there was a quick way to get rid of a
       mistaken request</LI>

       <LI><CODE>wwwoffle-cache-regexp-rm</CODE> -- remove things
       via regular expression from the WWWOFFLE cache -- an easy
       way to precision target something to blast from the
       cache</LI>

       <LI><CODE>wwwoffle-find-rerequest-candidates</CODE> -- find
       the URLs that messed up last time and are candidates for
       perhaps requesting again.</LI>

    <H2><CODE>ppp</CODE> tools</H2>

    <P>As WWWOFFLE users are also perhaps <CODE>ppp</CODE> users,
    here are also some ppp/modem related tools:</P>
