	* adding wwwoffle_cache variable as debian is different

2002-06-11  Dan Jacobson  <http://jidanni.org/>

	* forced gawk and added IGNORECASE=1 to wwwoffle-outgoing-regexp-rm

2002-06-08  Dan Jacobson  <http://jidanni.org/>

	* added -i to wwwoffle-outgoing-regexp-rm

	output too much...

	* wwwoffle-chunks (ts): if can read .timestamp, can do better file
	dates

2002-02-13  Dan Jacobson

	* wwwoffle-chunks (defaultsortstyle): now alpha.  P.S. my attitude
	is this is a little program used by [anybody else than me?] so
	radical changes are possible with no warning.

	* wwwoffle-chunks (datestr): [if can read wwwoffle tree] making
	shortest dates in filenames that will sort nicely... now look to
	the date field in your browser instead of the filename for date
	information.

	* wwwoffle-chunks: moved link to wwwoffle indexes to top of page,
	got rid of empty last file possibility.  Noticed that &'s in URLs
	are illegal html... that don't pass the validator.  using 'strict' DTD

2001-10-30  Dan Jacobson

	* added link to wwwoffle index to bottom of pages produced.  now
	one can perhaps set ones HOME button to be the wwwoffle-chunks dir
	and still be a click or two away from the full wwwoffle index.
