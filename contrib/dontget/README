                        WWWOFFLE DontGet Lists
                        ======================

The potential sources of lists of URLs to put into the DontGet section of the
WWWOFFLE configuration file are listed below.  There is a description of the
location of the file, the purpose, the type of information that it contains and
the name of a program in this directory that can convert it to the WWWOFFLE
format.


WWWOFFLE
--------

I maintain a copy of my personal WWWOFFLE DontGet list on the WWWOFFLE Hints and
Tips page.

http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/version-2.7/hints-tips.html

Just download the DontGet.txt file and use it.  A copy is also available in this
directory.


JunkBuster
----------

Homepage: http://www.junkbusters.com/ijb.html

This is one of the original advert blocking proxies (not replacement), it also
allows blocking of cookies and some other headers, it does not allow for HTML
re-writing.

URL lists: http://www.google.com/search?q=junkbuster+blockfile&num=100

Since these lists are published by Junkbuster users their contents is varied.

Conversion: junkbuster.pl junkbuster.sh

Use the either the Perl script or the user-friendly shell script.

        junkbuster.pl blockfile > wwwoffle.DontGet.junkbuster

        junkbuster.sh

The URL lists allow for the use of regular expressions (which WWWOFFLE does not
support) the script converts those that it can.


SquidGuard
----------

Homepage: http://www.squidguard.org/

This is an add-on for the Squid proxy that allows URLs to be blocked or
redirected.

URL lists: http://www.squidguard.org/blacklist/

These lists contain adverts, pornographic sites, sites encouraging illegal
activities etc.

Conversion: squidguard.pl squidguard.sh

Use the either the Perl script or the user-friendly shell script.

        squidguard.pl blacklists/ads/domains > wwwoffle.DontGet.squidguard

        squidguard.sh

SquidGuard allows for the use of regular expressions (which WWWOFFLE does not
support) but the lists do not contain them.


AdZap
-----

Homepage: http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/adzap/

This is a simple advert blocking filter add-on for Squid that offers different
replacements.

URL lists: http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/rc/adzap/patterns

These lists are basically adverts.

Conversion: adzap.pl adzap.sh

Use the either the Perl script or the user-friendly shell script.

        adzap.pl patterns > wwwoffle.DontGet.adzap

        adzap.sh

AdZap allows for something close to regular expressions (which WWWOFFLE does not
support) the script converts what it can of them.
