Building wwwoffle 2.7d fror Redhat systems
==========================================

I enclose some files I use for building wwwoffle 2.7d RPMs.

wwwoffle.spec
=============

wwwoffle.spec is the most important, it tells the rpm command how to build the RPMs.

Copy this file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS.

DontGet.txt
===========

[see the directory ../dontget]

Copy this file to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.

wwwoffle_hints-tips.txt
=======================

This is just a copy of
http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/version-2.7/hints_tips.html
rendered to text by Netscape.

Copy this file to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.

wwwoffled.rc
============

This is the init script that will be copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d.

Copy this file to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.


wwwoffle-2.7d.tgz
=================

Copy http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/download-wwwoffle/wwwoffle-2.7d.tgz
to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.


The build
=========

Just cd to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS, then type 'rpm -ba wwwoffle.spec'
this will build a binary RPM in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/.

The sorce RPM will be in /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/.


Channges from the defaults
==========================

The daemon runs with user and group IDs wwwoffle, which are created
during the install of thhe binary RPM.

The configuration files are stored in a new directory /etc/wwwoffle
which is owned by the new user 'wwwoffle', allowing run-time
reconfiguration via the web pages.

/var/spool/wwwoffle has empty subdirectories ftp and finger.


Notes
=====

Based upon the RPM for wwwoffle 2.6 found on rpmfind.net, including
the trenslations of the descriptions and summaries.

The user is left to update /etc/ppp/ip-{up,down}.local.  I use 
'wwwoffle -online' and 'wwwoffle -fetch' in ip-up.local, and
'wwwoffle -offline' in ip-down.local.


Compatibility
=============

Builds fine under Redhat 6.2 and 7.2, so should also build on all
recent distributions.
