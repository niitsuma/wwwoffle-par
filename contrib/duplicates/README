The point of looking at the cached headers is to see why the file was
fetched more than once.  The sort of things that might be seen are:

Different 'Expires' headers for recent dates
        WWWOFFLE is re-fetching the page because the headers say that
        the page has expired.  You can stop WWWOFFLE doing this by
        setting 'request-expired = no' in the OnlineOptions section of
        the wwwoffle.conf file.

A 'Cache-Control: no-cache' or 'Pragma: no-cache' header
        WWWOFFLE is re-fetching the page because it contains a header
        that says that it is not to be cached.  You can stop WWWOFFLE
        doing this by setting 'reqeust-no-cache = no' in the
        OnlineOptions section of the wwwoffle.conf file.

A 'Cache-Control: max-age=...' header and a 'Date' header
        The specified age in seconds needs to be added to the date,
        this sets an expiry time for the page and is treated the same
        way as an 'Expires' header.

Different 'ETag' headers
        WWWOFFLE is re-fetching the page because when it asks the
        server if the page has changed (a different Etag) the server
        says that it has (even though it may not have changed).
        Disabling this will become an option in the next version of
        WWWOFFLE.

This has probably been refetched because of the Etag header.
